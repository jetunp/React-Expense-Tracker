//Reducer fn is basically how we specify the app state changes in response to certain actions to our context
//instead of useState we use useReducer as when a state is event triggered many times for diff actions to be 
// performed it gets complex and better to use reducer fn.
export default (state,action) => {
    switch(action.type){
        default:
            return state
